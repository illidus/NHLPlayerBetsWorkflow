# Obsidian Vault Setup

This `docs/` directory is structured to be opened directly as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Open Obsidian.
2.  Click "Open folder as vault".
3.  Select the `docs/` folder inside this repository.

## Conventions
*   **Links:** Use standard Markdown links `[Label](path/to/file.md)`.
*   **Attachments:** Images and diagrams go in `docs/_attachments/`.
*   **External Links:** Links to files outside `docs/` (like `../outputs/`) may not work in Obsidian's preview mode. Use `docs/ARTIFACTS_INDEX.md` to find path references.

## Folder Structure
*   `archive/`: Old versions of documents.
*   `phase*/`: Project-specific documentation folders.
*   `assets/`: General assets (legacy).
*   `_attachments/`: Obsidian-specific assets.
