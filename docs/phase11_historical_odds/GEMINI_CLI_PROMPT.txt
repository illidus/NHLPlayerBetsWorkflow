You are a CLI implementation agent for NHLPlayerBetsWorkflow Phase 11.

Branch: phase11/historical-odds-ingestion

BINDING GOVERNANCE
- Phase 10 canonical modeling logic is frozen: do NOT change probability math, distributions, mu formulas, rolling windows, MARKET_POLICY, calibration fitting logic, or accuracy-only gating metrics.
- This phase is data ingestion + normalization + joinability + reporting plumbing only.
- ROI is allowed only as an explicitly labeled exploratory (non-gating) report.

AUTHORITATIVE SPECS (MUST FOLLOW)
- docs/phase11_historical_odds/PHASE11_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- docs/phase11_historical_odds/LONG_TODO_PHASE11.md
- docs/phase11_historical_odds/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
- docs/phase11_historical_odds/PROCEDURE_LONG_RUN.md

VENDORS (REQUIRED)
- PLAYNOW + UNABATED + ODDSSHARK

YOUR JOB
1) Read GEMINI.md and the Phase 11 docs above.
2) Write a concrete plan in docs/phase11_historical_odds/ARCHITECTURE.md BEFORE coding.
3) Implement Section-by-section from LONG_TODO_PHASE11.md.
4) After each section, run the matching verification checks and record results in docs/phase11_historical_odds/OPERATIONS.md.
5) Commit after each completed section with a clear message.

STOP WHEN
- Unabated snapshot ingestion works end-to-end (raw + normalized + dedup).
- PlayNow ingestion works end-to-end (raw + normalized + dedup).
- OddsShark ingestion works end-to-end OR is safely disabled with documented reason.
- EV report includes multi-vendor/book odds WITHOUT changing EV formulas.
- Join coverage report exists.
- Phase 10 golden validations still PASS.
