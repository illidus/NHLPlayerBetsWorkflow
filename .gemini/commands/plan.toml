Your role is a Lead ML Engineer. Your task is to implement 'Phase 8: Model Enhancement' based on the Phase 7 results.

1. **Step 1: Data Pipeline Updates**
    - Read `30_pipelines/build_probability_snapshots.py` and `30_pipelines/build_goalie_game_situation.py`.
    - Plan the integration of `opp_sa60` and `goalie_gsax60` into the snapshots.

2. **Step 2: Logic Enhancement**
    - Analyze `nhl_bets/probs/single_game_model.py`.
    - Propose how to use `mult_opp_g` and `mult_goalie` to adjust the mu (expected value) for goals and assists.

3. **Step 3: Execution**
    - Provide a checklist of code changes required.
    - Do not implement yet; wait for user confirmation.

Inputs Provided:
- Current project status: Phase 7 Backtest ROI improved to -4.13%.
- Goal: Fix 'Assist' market leaks and 'October' volatility.
